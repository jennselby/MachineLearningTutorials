    "1. Install h5, with `python3 -m pip install h5py`\n",
    "1. Download the three h5 files: [generator](https://github.com/jennselby/MachineLearningTutorials/raw/master/generator.h5), [discriminator](https://github.com/jennselby/MachineLearningTutorials/raw/master/discriminator.h5), and [combined](https://github.com/jennselby/MachineLearningTutorials/raw/master/combined.h5) and save them in the same folder as this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you haven't already installed Keras, follow these directions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type `python3 --version` into Terminal. If the output starts with \"Python 3.6\", skip to step 3. **Tensorflow does not yet work with Python 3.7, so you _must_ get Python 3.6.** See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20517 for updates on 3.7 support.\n",
    "1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click on \"Python 3.6.8\". Scroll down to the Files section and click on \"macOS 64-bit installer\". Run the installer and follow the directions. Repeat step 1 to make sure it has successfully installed. \n",
    "1. Set up Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "    * If you had already previously installed juypter notebook with Python 3.7:\n",
    "        1. Install ipykernel in Python 3.6. (_Make sure python3 is actually Python 3.6_!)\n",
    "            >`python3 -m pip install ipykernel`\n",
    "        1. Add this kernel as an option for your jupyter notebook:\n",
    "            >`python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name python-3-6 --display-name \"Python 3.6\"`\n",
    "    * Otherwise install jupyter notebook by typing the following into Terminal:\n",
    "        >`pip3 install jupyter`\n",
    "1. Start the jupyter notebook by typing in Terminal _in the same folder that you have this file_ \n",
    "    `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "    1. This should open a tab in your web browser with a list of files in the folder. Click on this ipynb file to open it.\n",
    "    1. If you installed a second kernel in step 3, go to the Kernel menu and choose \"Change Kernel\" and then select Python 3.6\n",
    "1. Install the tensorflow machine learning library by typing the following into Terminal:\n",
    "    >`python3 -m pip install --upgrade tensorflow`\n",
    "1. Install the keras machine learning library by typing the following into Terminal:\n",
    "    >`python3 -m pip install keras`\n",
    "1. Install the libraries we'll need to display the images:\n",
    "    > `python3 -m pip numpy matplotlib`\n",
    "1. Test that the keras install worked: Type `python3` into the Terminal. When the `>>>` prompt comes up, type `from keras.models import Sequential`. If you don't get any error output, then it worked. Type Ctrl+d (or close the window) to exit.\n",
    "    * If you get an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'theano'` then you need to switch the backend to tensorflow. See the instructions at https://keras.io/backend/ or ask me for help.\n",
    "    * If you get a warning like `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/importlib/_bootstrap.py:219: RuntimeWarning: compiletime version 3.5 of module 'tensorflow.python.framework.fast_tensor_util' does not match runtime version 3.6` you can ignore it. This is a known (trivial) issue with Tensorflow 1.4 for OSX. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/14182 if you'd like more details."
